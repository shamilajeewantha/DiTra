Speaker 0: See you.  Nice to see you again.  What brings you back?  

Speaker 1: Well, my back's been hurting again.  

Speaker 0: I see.  I've seen you a number of times for this, haven't I?  

Speaker 1: Well, ever since I got hurt on the job three years ago, it's something that just keeps coming back.  It'll be fine for a while and then I'll bend down or I'll move in a weird way and then boom, it'll just go out again.  

Speaker 0: Unfortunately, that can happen.  And I do have quite a few patients who get reoccurring episodes of back pain.  Have you been keeping up with the therapy that we had you on before?  

Speaker 1: The pills?  

Speaker 0: Actually, I was talking about the physical therapy that we had you doing.  The pills are only meant for short term because they don't actually prevent the back pain from coming back?  

Speaker 1: Once my back started feeling better, I was happy not to go to the therapist anymore.  Why was that?  It was starting to become kind of a hassle.
