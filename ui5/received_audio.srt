1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,580
Speaker 0: See you.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,640
Speaker 0: Nice to see you again.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,340
Speaker 0: What brings you back?

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,320
Speaker 1: Well, my back's been hurting again.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,340
Speaker 0: I see.

6
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,480
Speaker 0: I've seen you a number of times for this, haven't I?

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,340
Speaker 1: Well, ever since I got hurt on the job three years ago, it's something that just keeps coming back.

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:28,360
Speaker 1: It'll be fine for a while and then I'll bend down or I'll move in a weird way and then boom, it'll just go out again.

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,759
Speaker 0: Unfortunately, that can happen.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,740
Speaker 0: And I do have quite a few patients who get reoccurring episodes of back pain.

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,560
Speaker 0: Have you been keeping up with the therapy that we had you on before?

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,440
Speaker 1: The pills?

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,300
Speaker 0: Actually, I was talking about the physical therapy that we had you doing.

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:02,700
Speaker 0: The pills are only meant for short term because they don't actually prevent the back pain from coming back?

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,240
Speaker 1: Once my back started feeling better, I was happy not to go to the therapist anymore.

16
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,580
Speaker 1: Why was that?

17
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,100
Speaker 1: It was starting to become kind of a hassle.
