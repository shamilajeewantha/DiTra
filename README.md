# DiTra

## simple web app received audio and records it and save it as a wav file at the end

## chunking webapp saves when the recording hits 30s so for the duration of the recording, we get multiple wav files representing chunks

## whisper webapp sends 30s chunks through the models and logs transcription instead of saving them as wav.

## next I will do VAD
